Note - please use http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit to visualise and understand my code ( and its flow) in case you dont understand it . ( Also i used this site to debug my code too :P   and my booth algorithm assignment python code too . it's an amazing site and helps you understand what you wanted to do and what your code is ACTUALLY DOING)


Cache Assignment
A cache of size S with CL as the number of cache lines and block size B is to be built. S, CL, and B are in
powers of 2. Write a program that allows loading into cache and searching cache using:
1. Direct mapping
2. Associative memory
3. n-way set associative memory where n is a power of 2.

Any programming language (of your choice) can be used.

Bonus task - (Weightage - 12%)

Task - Build a 2 level cache. The size of the level 1 cache is S/2 and the size of level 2 cache is S. All the
other parameters are to be decided accordingly. This will also be a standalone cache without the
intervention of the main memory.
